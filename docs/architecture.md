# AI Software Company Desktop Console Architecture

## Product Shape

AI Software Company Desktop Console is a commercial multi-agent software engineering control plane. It is not a collection of chat windows. The long-term architecture is a desktop client, cloud control plane, model router, agent orchestrator, execution plane, and approval/audit system.

## Target Architecture

```text
Tauri Desktop Client
  -> Cloud Control Plane
  -> Agent Orchestrator
  -> LLM Gateway / Model Router
  -> Sandbox Workers / Local Runner
  -> Git Worktree / Tests / Review / PR
```

## Phase 0 Boundary

Phase 0 builds the runnable monorepo foundation:

- Vite React desktop shell.
- FastAPI control-plane API.
- JSON Schema Agent protocol.
- Deterministic LLM gateway interface.
- Mock worker simulator.
- SQLite-backed tests.
- PostgreSQL and Redis reservations in Docker Compose.

Phase 0 does not perform real model calls, real Tauri builds, real code patching, real billing, production auth, or cloud sandbox execution.

## First Runtime Flow

```text
User enters goal
  -> desktop shell requests a planner run
  -> FakePlanner creates structured TaskSpec drafts
  -> user approves or rejects the batch
  -> approved drafts become normal tasks
  -> task events capture audit trail
  -> desktop right panel shows created tasks
```

The desktop task client defaults to mock mode when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is unset
so demos and tests stay deterministic. Setting
`VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000` enables the minimal HTTP integration:
the desktop resolves or creates a demo project, creates planner runs, approves
or rejects generated drafts, and maps approved tasks into the right-panel task
board.

## Phase 2 Boundary

Phase 2 adds backend control-plane records for model providers, BYOK credentials, model routes, and usage ledger entries. Route resolution is metadata-only: if no planner route is configured, the API returns a deterministic fake planner route so the Phase 1 planner approval flow keeps working.

Credentials are write-only through the API. The server stores a development encrypted-secret placeholder and returns only credential metadata such as `secret_last4`. Phase 2 does not make real OpenAI-compatible or DeepSeek network calls.

## Roadmap

Completed:

1. Phase 0 monorepo foundation with desktop shell, API, agent protocol, deterministic gateway interface, mock worker simulator, and local test infrastructure.
2. Phase 1 planner approval loop with fake planner drafts, human approval or rejection, task creation, and audit trail events.
3. Backend-first model router and BYOK foundation with provider metadata, write-only credential records, role-based route resolution, fake fallback routes, and append-only usage logging.

Future:

1. Real model-backed planner path that uses route resolution to create TaskSpec for approval.
2. Local Runner that reads repositories, creates worktrees, generates diffs, and lets users review patches.
3. Automated tests, reviewer loop, and debug loop.
4. Cloud sandbox workers, GitHub/GitLab integration, artifacts, and PR creation.
5. Commercial beta with users, organizations, subscriptions, credit wallet, usage ledger, rate limits, and billing provider abstraction.
